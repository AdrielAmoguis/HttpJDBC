# HttpJDBC
This is a side-project I wished I never had to make. TL;DR, corporate firewall blocks our PostgreSQL and there's so much corporate crap to get it unblocked, but apparently now because our Azure subscription isn't owned by a specific department, we can't do anything about it. So here I am, making an HTTP proxy to PostgreSQL. I hate my life.
