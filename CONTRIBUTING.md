# Contributing

Hey there, I'm glad you're interested in contributing to this project.

Honestly, this really is a project that I didn't want to make, but corporate shenanigans has forced my hand.

Anyways, I'll be maintaining this at a skeletal-level. If you can see, there's a a ton of JDBC-supported methods I have here in the `Connection` and `Statement` level that are unimplemented. If you want to implement them, feel free to do so.

I'll be checking pull requests and issues from time to time, but I can't guarantee that I'll be able to respond quickly. Should you submit a pull request that needs to be expedited, do send me an email at
[adriel.isaiah.amoguis@gmail.com](mailto:adriel.isaiah.amoguis@gmail.com) with the subject line "HTTP JDBC Driver - Pull Request / Issue" so I can prioritize it.

Thanks, I hope you never have to use this driver in production-- nor deal with corporate shenanigans that would require you to use this driver in the first place.
